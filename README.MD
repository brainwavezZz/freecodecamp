# Testing out GITHUB with freecodecamp

Steps
1. Create a repository
2. Add and commit file(s)
    2A. Committed state
            A file is in the committed state when all the changes made to the file have been saved in the local repo. Files in the committed stage are files ready to be pushed to the remote repo (on GitHub).
    2B. Modified state
            A file in the modified state has some changes made to it but it's not yet saved. This means that the state of the file has been altered from its previous state in the committed state.

    2C. Staged state
            A file in the staged state means it is ready to be committed. In this state, all necessary changes have been made so the next step is to move the file to the commit state.

3. Push the repository to GitHub
    After you create the repo, you should be redirected to a page that tells you how to create a repo locally or push an existing one.

Commands;

A. git status
